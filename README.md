Each folder or script (under `data/`) generally corresponds to one ingestion pattern or sample. The SQL scripts and configuration files define staging, file formats, copy commands, and pipeline logic.

*(If there are more subfolders or Python / Java scripts inside `data/`, those correspond to specific ingestion flows — you may want to document each of them with sub-readmes or comments.)*

## Setup & Prerequisites

Before you run these examples, you’ll want to ensure:

- A **Snowflake account** with sufficient privileges (ability to create warehouses, databases, schemas, stages, pipes)  
- A local environment (Python, Java, or whatever the scripts use)  
- Credentials (username/private key or other auth method) configured (e.g. via environment variables or a `.env` file)  
- If you use external storage (e.g. S3, Azure Blob), appropriate policy / IAM roles and trust setups  
- Network configuration (for Snowflake to access your external storage, if applicable)  

You may need to adjust file paths, database/schema names, and warehouse sizes.

## How to Run / Usage

A typical flow might go like this:

1. **Initialize schema & objects**  
   Use provided SQL scripts to create databases, schemas, tables, stages, file formats, and pipes.

2. **Load sample data**  
   Data in `data/` directory (JSON, CSV, etc.) can be used as input.

3. **Run ingestion scripts**  
   For each ingestion method, there will be a script (Python / SQL / shell) to:

   - Read or generate data  
   - Batch / transform as needed  
   - Upload or stage files  
   - Invoke `COPY INTO` or trigger Snowpipe / event ingestion  

4. **Verify & query data in Snowflake**  
   Check the target tables, compare counts, latency, and resource usage.

5. **Compare performance & cost metrics**  
   Use Snowflake’s query history, credits usage, and other observability tools.

You should document in each ingestion folder the precise command(s) to run (e.g. `python ingest_copy.py --batch-size 10000`) and any required arguments.

## Comparisons & Trade-offs

When comparing the ingestion patterns, consider:

- **Throughput** (rows per second)  
- **Latency** (time from ingestion to query availability)  
- **Resource cost / warehouse usage**  
- **Complexity / operational overhead**  
- **Small-file performance** (how ingestion behaves when you have many small files)  
- **Error handling & retry semantics**

Typically:

- Single-row inserts are simplest but don’t scale  
- Bulk load (staging + COPY) is efficient for large batches  
- Snowpipe is better for continual ingestion without managing warehouses constantly  
- Tasks / merging logic can help alleviate inefficiencies with many small files  

---

## Best Practices & Recommendations

- Aim for **larger file sizes** (e.g. ~100-250 MB) to maximize COPY throughput  
- Use **compression** (Parquet / gzipped CSV) to reduce transfer overhead  
- Use **consistent column-naming, casing, and file formats**  
- Monitor ingestion latency, pipe backlogs, and processing queues  
- Implement **retry logic** and **idempotency**  
- Clean up / archive staged files once ingested  
- Use **role separation**: a dedicated ingest role / user  
- If small files are unavoidable, consider merging or batching upstream

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you wish to:

1. Add a new ingestion method (e.g. via Kafka connector, CDC, or DBT)  
2. Improve existing scripts or add more robust error handling  
3. Add performance benchmarks, visualizations, or cost models  
4. Enhance documentation or examples  

Please open an issue or submit a pull request. Make sure your additions include clear instructions, sample data, and validation steps.
